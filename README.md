# Baby Name Blossoms

## Introduction
[Baby Name Blossoms](https://baby-name-blossoms.netlify.app/) is a data visualization project inspired by [filmflowers](https://sxywu.com/filmflowers/). It is a single-page application built with React App and with implementation of D3.js.

## Visualization
Based on the data from [ssa.gov](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/index.html), this project visualizes top 10 girl and boy names in the USA over the past 10 decades.
- Each name is represented with a flower
- The number of petals in each flower represents the popularity of the name 
- The colored circles inside each flower reflect the vowels of the name: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'y'. For example, `Emma` has two circles, which reflect the letters 'E' and 'a'.
